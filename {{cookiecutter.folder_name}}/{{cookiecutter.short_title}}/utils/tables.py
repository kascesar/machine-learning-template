"""
This module is dedicated to creating an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) 
system for your database as needed.

In this module, you can define your database schema by creating SQLAlchemy 
models or SQLModel tables. Once defined, these models will automatically be 
translated into the corresponding tables within the selected database.

### Considerations

1. **Define Models**: Create your SQLAlchemy or SQLModel classes by 
   specifying the fields and their types. Each class represents a table in 
   the database.
  
2. **Automatic Table Creation**: When you run your application, the defined 
   models will be used to create the necessary tables in the database you've 
   configured.

3. **Database Configuration**: Ensure that you have set up your database 
   connection string and any other required settings prior to executing the 
   application. This will allow the ORM to connect to the correct database 
   and perform operations as intended.


**For example**:

```mermaid

classDiagram
    class User {
        +int id
        +string username
        +string email
    }
    
    class Post {
        +int id
        +string title
        +string content
        +int user_id
    }
    
    User "1" <-- "0..*" Post : has

```

that was generated with this code

```python
from sqlmodel import SQLModel, Field, Relationship
from typing import List, Optional

class User(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    username: str
    email: str
    posts: List["Post"] = Relationship(back_populates="author")

class Post(SQLModel, table=True):
    id: Optional[int] = Field(default=None, primary_key=True)
    title: str
    content: str
    user_id: int = Field(foreign_key="user.id")
    author: User = Relationship(back_populates="posts")

```
