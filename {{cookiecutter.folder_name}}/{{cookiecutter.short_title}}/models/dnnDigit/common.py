# Helper Function for Model Development

## Purpose

The helper function serves as a utility to streamline common tasks in the model development process. These tasks can include data preprocessing, model evaluation, or any repetitive operations that enhance code readability and efficiency.

## Example Helper Function: Normalize Data

### Description

The **Normalize Data** helper function is designed to normalize the pixel values of the MNIST dataset to a range between 0 and 1. This preprocessing step is crucial for improving the convergence speed and overall performance of the neural network.

### Functionality

- **Input:** The function takes in an array of pixel values from the dataset.
- **Process:** It converts the pixel values, which range from 0 to 255, into a normalized format between 0 and 1. This is achieved by dividing each pixel value by 255.
- **Output:** The normalized array is returned, making it suitable for input into the neural network.

### Usage

This helper function is typically called during the data preparation phase. By normalizing the dataset before feeding it into the model, the training process can benefit from improved convergence rates and potentially better overall performance.

## Conclusion

Helper functions like the **Normalize Data** function are essential for maintaining clean and efficient code. They encapsulate specific functionalities, making the main workflow easier to read and understand. By organizing code into modular functions, developers can enhance collaboration and reduce redundancy in their projects.
