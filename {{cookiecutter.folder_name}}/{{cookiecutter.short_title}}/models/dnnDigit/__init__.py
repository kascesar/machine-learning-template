# Deep Neural Network (DNN) for MNIST Classification

## Introduction

The MNIST dataset is a widely used benchmark in the field of machine learning and computer vision, consisting of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0 to 9). Each image has a resolution of 28x28 pixels, which translates to a total of 784 pixels. The goal of the DNN model is to accurately classify these images into their respective digit categories.

## Architecture

The proposed DNN architecture includes several layers, each designed to perform specific computations and transformations on the input data. The architecture can be summarized as follows:

1. **Input Layer:**
   - **Size:** 784 neurons (one for each pixel in a 28x28 image).
   - **Function:** This layer receives the pixel values of the input images, flattening the 2D image into a 1D array of size 784.

2. **Hidden Layers:**
   - **Layer 1:**
     - **Size:** 128 neurons.
     - **Activation Function:** ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit).
     - **Function:** This layer learns complex patterns in the data by applying weights and biases to the input features. The ReLU activation introduces non-linearity, allowing the model to capture intricate relationships.
   
   - **Layer 2:**
     - **Size:** 64 neurons.
     - **Activation Function:** ReLU.
     - **Function:** Similar to the first hidden layer, this layer processes the output from the first layer, allowing for further feature extraction and representation learning.

3. **Output Layer:**
   - **Size:** 10 neurons (one for each digit from 0 to 9).
   - **Activation Function:** Softmax.
   - **Function:** This layer outputs the predicted probabilities for each class (digit). The Softmax function ensures that the output values are in the range [0, 1] and sum to 1, making it suitable for multi-class classification.

## Training Process

The training of the DNN involves several key steps:

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - The MNIST dataset is divided into a training set (60,000 images) and a test set (10,000 images).
   - Each pixel value is normalized to the range [0, 1] by dividing by 255 to improve convergence during training.

2. **Loss Function:**
   - The categorical cross-entropy loss function is used to measure the difference between the predicted probabilities and the actual class labels. This function is crucial for optimizing the model during training.

3. **Optimization Algorithm:**
   - The Adam optimizer is employed to update the model's weights and biases based on the gradients calculated from the loss function. Adam combines the benefits of AdaGrad and RMSProp, adapting the learning rate for each parameter.

4. **Training Loop:**
   - The model is trained over multiple epochs, with each epoch consisting of a complete pass through the training dataset. During each epoch, the modelâ€™s weights are updated to minimize the loss function.
   - Batch training is used, where the dataset is divided into smaller subsets (batches), allowing for more efficient computation and convergence.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - After training, the model's performance is evaluated on the test dataset using accuracy as the primary metric. The accuracy is calculated as the percentage of correctly classified images out of the total number of test images.

## Conclusion

The DNN for MNIST classification serves as a fundamental example of how deep learning can effectively solve image classification tasks. By leveraging multiple layers and non-linear activation functions, the model can learn complex features and make accurate predictions. This architecture can be further enhanced by incorporating techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and data augmentation to improve generalization and robustness.
